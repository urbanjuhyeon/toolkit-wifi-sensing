# Installation

This chapter prepares the hardware and software for a WiFi sensor. After assembling the **components**, you will install the **operating system** and establish **remote access** to the Pi via SSH. A **troubleshooting** section at the end covers common setup issues.

::: {.callout-note}
Screenshots were captured with Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye (2022). The current Bookworm release may have slightly different interfaces, but the overall process remains the same.

## Components

The WiFi sensor consists of a single-board computer, a wireless adapter for packet capture, and supporting peripherals for power and storage:

The core components are:

- **Raspberry Pi**: A single-board computer, Model 3 or newer, that serves as the main computing unit.
- **WiFi adapter**: An external USB adapter with monitor mode support for passive packet capture. The Pi's built-in WiFi can also enter monitor mode but may overheat during extended sessions.
- **Micro SD card**: A storage device of 16GB or larger for the operating system and captured data.
- **Ethernet cable**: A cable for connecting the Pi to your computer for initial SSH access.
- **Portable power bank**: A battery pack of 20,000mAh or higher for outdoor deployment.

Additional sensors such as cameras or environmental monitors can be added for extended data collection.

## Operating System

### Download the Pi Imager

Download the Raspberry Pi Imager from the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and install it on your computer.

![](materials/ch2/raspi_imager.png)

### Format the SD Card

Insert an SD card, launch the Imager, click `CHOOSE OS`, select `Erase`, then `Format SD Card`.

### Flash the OS

With the SD card formatted, install Raspberry Pi OS:

1. **Choose the OS**: Click `CHOOSE OS` and select Raspberry Pi OS.
2. **Choose the SD Card**: Select your SD card from the list.
3. **Enable SSH**: Required for remote access.
4. **Set Username and Password**: Default is `pi` / `raspberry`. Change after setup for security.
5. **Configure Wireless LAN**: Enter your mobile hotspot credentials for time synchronization at boot.
6. **Write**: Click `WRITE` to flash the OS.

Once complete, insert the SD card into the Pi to boot.

## Why use a mobile hotspot?

The Raspberry Pi has no real-time clock and needs internet access at boot to synchronize time. A mobile hotspot provides this connection reliably during field deployment.

## Remote Access

Choose a connection method based on your setup:

![](materials/ch2/choose_remote.png){width="85%"}

- **Option A (Ethernet):** For desktops without WiFi. See @sec-way1.
- **Option B (Mobile Hotspot):** For laptops with WiFi. See @sec-way2.

### Option A: Ethernet Cable {#sec-way1}

Connect your Pi to your computer using an Ethernet cable.

![](materials/ch2/connect_pi.jpg)

In your network settings, enable `Internet Connection Sharing`.

![](materials/ch2/share_network.mp4)

Open Command Prompt (`Ctrl + R`, type `cmd`, Enter) and connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi
```

![](materials/ch2/access_cmd.mp4)

### Option B: Mobile Hotspot {#sec-way2}

Enable your mobile hotspot with the same credentials you entered when flashing the SD card.

![](materials/ch2/hotspot_default.jpg){width="50%"}

Insert the SD card into the Pi and connect power.

![](materials/ch2/plug_pi_wifi.jpg)

Connect your laptop to the same hotspot.

![](materials/ch2/laptop_wifi.png){width="50%"}

Both devices should appear in your hotspot interface. Open Command Prompt and connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi
```

![](materials/ch2/ssh_laptop.mp4)

### Verify Internet Connectivity

Test the Pi's internet connection:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

A successful connection shows `64 bytes from 8.8.8.8`. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop.

![](materials/ch2/cmd_ping.mp4)

## Troubleshooting

### Network Connection Error

If you cannot access the Pi, try toggling your network adapter off and on, re-enabling Internet Connection Sharing, or checking the Ethernet connection.

![](materials/ch2/error_network.mp4)

### Finding the Pi's IP Address

When connecting to multiple Pis, you need specific IP addresses. Run `arp -a` in Command Prompt to list devices. Raspberry Pi MAC addresses start with `B8:27:EB` or `DC:A6:32`.

![](materials/ch2/access_with_mac.mp4)

### SSH Key Warning

This error appears after reinstalling the OS or changing SSH keys:

![](materials/ch2/ssh_error.png)

Remove the old key and reconnect:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R raspberrypi
```

### Secured Networks

University or corporate networks may require MAC address registration. Contact your IT administrator.
